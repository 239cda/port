    <p>Jell is a web application for managing teams, mainly through setting and sharing plans and individual progress. <br><br>We conducted user research and usability evaluation to identify potential problems the users may run into while using the app.  At the end, we summed up our findings in the final report.  </p>

        <h2>Research Process </h2>
    </div>
    <!--<div class="paragraph">-->
<!--<p>As a first step, we conducted an interview with the designer of Jell to gather information and learn his expectations for the project. </p>-->
    <!--</div>-->
    <div class="paragraph">
        <!--<h3>Problem Statement</h3>-->
        <div class="problemStatement">
        <p>From the beginning, the target users of Jell have been designers and developers working in the IT field.  Even now, the main focus is on the IT project managers. But there are some users they had not expected; for example, college students. Therefore, the team underwent changes to make the app more usable for the users without much technology expertise.
            <br><br>At the end of this project, the team would like to hear if there have been any issues or obstacles, from the viewpoint of those who are not biased.
        </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Based on this information, we created two personas and user scenarios.
        Our first persona was a college student without much technological expertise. Therefore, some words and layout designs that require no explanation for experienced web users may not be so obvious for her. She represented the new user group that requires intuitive and easy navigation.</p>
        <br><p>The second persona was a project manager for an IT company. He represented the traditional user group who is familiar with technology.
    </p>
</div>

    <div class="horizonBorder2">

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div><h2>What were the problems?</h2></div>
        <div class="flex">
        <div>
            <p>From cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation, and a few interviews, we could identify and categorize several problems with the application.</p>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <ul><li>Unnoticeable information</li>
            <li>unclear definition of menu functions</li>
            <li>Inconsistent actions between functions</li>
            <li>Insufficient functions the users want to use</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        <p>To confirm the validity of usability problems we found, we recruited more participants (total of 12) to conduct usability testing.  <br><br>Each session with the participant consisted of an introduction, background interview, usability testing on four tasks we designed, and post-testing interview. During the usability testing, we employed think-aloud protocol.
            <br><br>The results from the usability testing confirmed our results from previous evaluation within our groups.</p>

    <div class="horizonBorder2">

    </div>
    <div>
        <div><h2>Recommendations & Limitations</h2>
        <p>Our design recommendations included changing names of functions that caused confusion, having similar functions perform tasks in the same procedure, increasing text size and changing text color for inconspicuous messages, and offering more system feedback to the users.<br><br>
            At the same time, there were some limitations. First, we could not find and test a current user of Jell. Therefore, we could not discover problems the more experienced users may be going through. Furthermore, the data we generated from usability testing are a one-time data and we do not know if the problems were temporary or persistent.</p>
            <br><p>At the end of the project, we delivered two reports to the client; summarizing findings for usability testing with potential users and inside the group.</p>
