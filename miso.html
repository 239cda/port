        <div class="introDiv">
            <p>Our team worked on producing a brand-new design of Market Portal website of MISO. We conducted user research, created low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, and conducted usability testing to deliver the best design possible.  At the end, we delivered a formal presentation of our findings to the client along with the project report</p>

        <h2>Research Process </h2>
    </div>
    <!--<div class="paragraph">-->
    <!--<p>As a first step, we conducted an interview with the designer of Jell to gather information and learn his expectations for the project. </p>-->
    <!--</div>-->
    <div class="paragraph">
        <!--<h3>Problem Statement</h3>-->
        <div class="problemStatement">
            <p>Market Portal was developed in the 1990’s. Because it has not gone through any changes since, the interface and technology is quite outdated by now. The navigation is neither easy nor intuitive, and the visual design is not very appealing, either. There has been regular complaints from Market Portal users as well. Therefore, MISO would like the Market Portal redesigned with modern UI and better UX.</p>
            <br><p>At the end of this project, MISO would like to see a high-fidelity prototype of a newly designed Market Portal website.</p>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Based on this information, we created an online survey and distributed it to Market Portal users. We received 210 responses. The survey gathered information such as the most frequently used feature,
        the satisfaction level with the current system in terms of aesthetics and usability, the areas the users identify as problematic, as well as some suggestions on any new feature they would like to have. We used the information
        to create a persona of an energy trader who frequently uses the system and hopes for a more intuitive and efficient system that can save time and help her make less mistakes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="horizonBorder2">

    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div><h2>What were the problems?</h2></div>
        <div class="flex">
            <div>
                <p>From data gathered from the survey and several interviews, we could identify the five primary user needs and requirements. </p>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <ul><li><p>easier navigation throughout the website</p></li>
                        <li><p>better organization of applications</p></li>
                        <li><p>more modern UI</p></li>
                        <li><p>addition of search tab</p></li>
                        <li><p>addition of help tab</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    To satisfy the user needs, we produced a design that consisted of intuitive navigation that provides simplicity, consistency and efficiency, customization of the website based on user preferences.
                    UI designs that are familiar, concise, and in lines with industry standards these days, a search tab for looking up a function a user does not know where to find,
                    and a help feature that contains guidelines on performing certain actions.

        <div><h2>Prototypes</h2>
            <p>Based on the conceptual design, we created a low-fidelity prototype and conducted user testing with four MISO employees who were
                actual users of Market Portal and four colleagues for additional feedback. The testing included three tasks, and was conducted following think-aloud protocol.</p><br><br>
            <div class="flex">
                <div class="inlineImage">
                    <img src="image/miso_lowF.PNG">
                    <p>Low-fidelity prototype</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <br><br><br>
                    First of all, the feature they especially liked was the favorites feature, as they stated it would save time. They also liked that it was “very simple”
                    to use. Some participants reported that they would like to add as many favorites they would like, and reordering feature for favorite applications would be helpful.
                    <br></br>Moreover, they also liked the interface design and called it “modern.” One participant liked that the menu order and menu name stayed same as the participant was used to seeing and working with those menus.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, a participant liked the idea of opening an application as a pop-up window instead of redirecting the main browser window to another page.
                </p>

            </div>
            <p>After user testing with low-fidelity type, we modified the prototype to refine the design and reflect suggestions. </p>
            <br><br>
            <div class="flex">
                <div class="inlineImage">
                    <img src="image/miso_highF1.PNG">
                    <p>High-fidelity prototype 1</p>
                </div>
                <div class="inlineImage">
                    <img src="image/miso_highF2.PNG">
                    <p>High-fidelity prototype 2</p>
                </div>
            </div>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="horizonBorder2"></div>
    <div><h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Overall, the positive feedback from the participants reassured us that we were going in the right direction with our design.
        The project is complete with the presentation of high-fidelity prototype above, but these are some areas that we would liked to work on to improve the design further.
        <br><br>
        First, we would have liked to implement a feature for reordering favorite application, as the participants stated it
        would be very helpful to have such feature. The visual
        design of the favorite application section could have been discussed again, as there were some suggestion regarding the
        look and location of icons. On forms, we would have liked to change the text color to make it more
        clear to the viewers. It would also have been helpful to hear from the employees
        when deciding how to color-code input fields of a form. Likewise, it would have been beneficial
        to gather information on how the employees from different departments would like the
        chart area to look like.
